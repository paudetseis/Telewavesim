## Software for teleseismic body wave modeling through stacks of anisotropic layers

The structure of the Earth's crust and upper mantle gives useful information on the
internal composition and dynamics of our planet. Some of the most widely used techniques
to infer these properties are based on examining the effect of teleseismic body wave
(i.e., P and S waves that originate from distant earthquakes and arrive as plane waves)
propagation (e.g., transmission and scattering) through stratified media. Modeling the
seismic response from stacks of subsurface layers is therefore an essential tool in
characterizing their effect on observed seismograms.

This package contains `python` and `fortran` modules to synthesize teleseismic
body-wave propagation through stacks of generally anisotropic and strictly horizontal
layers using the matrix propagator approach of [Kennett (1983)](#references), as implemented
in [Thomson (1997)](#references).
The software also properly models reverberations from an overlying column of water using the R/T
matrix expressions of [Bostock and Trehu (2012)](#references),
effectively simulating ocean-bottom seismic (OBS) station recordings. The software
will be useful in a variety of teleseismic receiver-based studies, such as P or S
receiver functions, long-period P-wave polarization, shear-wave splitting from
core-refracted shear waves (i.e., SKS, SKKS), etc. It may also be the starting point
for stochastic inverse methods (e.g., Monte Carlo sampling). The main part of the
code is written in `fortran` with `python` wrappers. Common computational
workflows are covered in the Jupyter notebooks bundled with this package.

#### Contributing

All constructive contributions are welcome, e.g. bug reports, discussions or suggestions for new features. You can either [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/paudetseis/Telewavesim/issues) or make a pull request with your proposed changes. Before making a pull request, check if there is a corresponding issue opened and reference it in the pull request. If there isn't one, it is recommended to open one with your rationale for the change. New functionality or significant changes to the code that alter its behavior should come with corresponding tests and documentation. If you are new to contributing, you can open a work-in-progress pull request and have it iteratively reviewed.

Examples of straightforward contributions include adding more elastic constants or notebooks that describe published examples of teleseismic body-wave modeling. Suggestions for improvements (speed, accuracy, etc.) are also welcome.
