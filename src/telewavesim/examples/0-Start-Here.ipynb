    "\n",
    "The structure of the Earth's crust and upper mantle gives useful information on the \n",
    "internal composition and dynamics of our planet. Some of the most widely used techniques\n",
    "to infer these properties are based on examining the effect of teleseismic body wave \n",
    "(i.e., P and S waves that originate from distant earthquakes and arrive as plane waves)\n",
    "propagation (e.g., transmission and scattering) through stratified media. Modeling the \n",
    "seismic response from stacks of subsurface layers is therefore an essential tool in \n",

    "body-wave propagation through stacks of generally anisotropic and strictly horizontal \n",

    "The software also properly models reverberations from an overlying column of water, \n",
    "effectively simulating ocean-bottom seismic (OBS) station recordings. The software \n",
    "will be useful in a variety of teleseismic receiver-based studies, such as P or S \n",

    "\n",
    "## Navigation / Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Included in this package is a set of Jupyter Notebooks, which give examples on how to call the various routines and obtain plane wave seismograms and receiver functions. The Notebooks describe how to reproduce published examples of synthetic data from [Audet (2016)](#references) and [Porter et al. (2011)](#references).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version was developed using **Python3.7**\n",
    "Also, the following packages are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [`gfortran`](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran) (or any Fortran compiler)\n",
    "- [`obspy`](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)\n",
    "- [`pyfftw`](https://pyfftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "By  default, both `numpy` and `matplotlib` are installed as dependencies of `obspy`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `telewavesim` using the [pip package manager](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install telewavesim\n",
    "```\n",
    "All the dependencies will be automatically installed by `pip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing with conda\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install `telewavesim` using the [conda package manager](https://conda.io).\n",
    "Its required dependencies can be easily installed with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install obspy pyfftw -c conda-forge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `telewavesim` can be installed with `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install telewavesim\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conda environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend creating a custom \n",

    "where `telewavesim` can be installed along with its dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a environment called `tws` and install all dependencies:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n tws python=3.7 obspy pyfftw -c conda-forge\n",

    "git checkout https://github.com/paudetseis/Telewavesim.git\n",
    "cd Telewavesim\n",

    "### Installing from source\n",
    "\n",
    "First clone the repository:\n",

    "git clone https://github.com/paudetseis/Telewavesim.git\n",
    "cd Telewavesim\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we recommend following the steps for creating a `conda` environment (see above). Then install using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install .\n",

    "**NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are actively working on the code, or making frequent edits, it is advisable to perform \n",
    "installation from source with the `-e` flag: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables an editable installation, where symbolic links are used rather than straight \n",
    "copies. This means that any changes made in the local folders will be reflected in the \n",
    "package available on the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Telewavesim consists of Python wrappers around Fortran routines that return the Fourier transform of displacement seismograms in three components (see `Jupyter` notebooks for details). The Python modules can be used to define new elastic stiffness matrices or change the input parameters for the Fortran subroutines. Python modules are available for post-processing as well (e.g., calculation of receiver functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "A series of tests are located in the ``tests`` subdirectory. In order to perform these tests, clone the reposotiry and run `pytest` (`conda install pytest` if needed):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout https://github.com/paudetseis/Telewavesim.git\n",
    "cd Telewavesim\n",
    "pytest -v\n",
